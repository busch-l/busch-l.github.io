As a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, I'm building a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and computer organization. While I've always been interested in how systems work, my passion for securing them truly crystallized during my IT internship at Franchino Mold & Engineering.

There, I moved beyond theory and was trusted to lead practical security initiatives. I strengthened the company's security posture by deploying Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical devices, researched Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to protect corporate data, and enhanced network visibility by inventorying and documenting over 60 network devices. This hands-on experience solidified my career path and motivated me to dive deeper.

To formalize my understanding of network fundamentals, I earned my **CompTIA Network+** certification and am now actively studying for the **CompTIA Security+**. To apply these concepts in a practical, hands-on environment, I've built my own cybersecurity home lab. This project, detailed in my portfolio, allows me to simulate real-world attacks, analyze network traffic, and get hands-on experience with tools like **Wazuh (SIEM)** and **pfSense (Firewall)**.

I am actively seeking a **Cybersecurity Internship for Summer 2026** where I can contribute my analytical mindset and growing passion for defense to a dynamic team.
