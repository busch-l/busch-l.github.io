While studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan, I am building a foundation in software through coursework like **Data Structures & Algorithms** and exploring cybersecurity passion in the course **Introduction to Computer Security**. My passion is fueled by a desire to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world security challenges, which I have pursued both through professional experience and hands-on projects.

I currently work as a **Tech Help Consultant** for the University of Michigan's IT Services, where I provide technical support to the community, resolving hardware, software, and security issues. This role builds on my experience as an **IT Support Intern** at Franchino Mold & Engineering, where I was trusted to lead practical initiatives that strengthened their security posture. There, I deployed Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical accounts, documented over 60 network devices to improve incident response, and analyzed firewall rules to enhance network security.

To dive deeper into defensive and offensive security, I am developing projects that bridge my software and security interests. I architected a **cybersecurity home lab** using VirtualBox, pfSense, and a Wazuh SIEM to simulate and detect real-world attacks using tools like Nmap and Metasploit. Additionally, I am developing an **AI-powered phishing email detector** in Python, leveraging NLTK and Scikit-learn to classify malicious emails. My hands-on work is supported by foundational knowledge validated by my **CompTIA Security+** and **CompTIA Network+** certifications.

I am also a new member of **WolvSec**, the university's cybersecurity club, and am seeking a **Cybersecurity Internship for Summer 2026** where I can contribute my analytical mindset and growing skills to a dynamic team.
