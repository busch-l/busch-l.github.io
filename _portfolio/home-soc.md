title: "Cybersecurity Home Lab for Attack Detection & Analysis"
excerpt: "A virtualized lab environment built to simulate, detect, and analyze common cyber attacks using pfSense (Firewall) and Wazuh (SIEM/XDR)."
collection: portfolio

As a practical application of the concepts learned through my CompTIA studies and Computer Science curriculum, I architected and deployed this fully functional, virtualized Security Operations Center (SOC) from the ground up. The primary objective was to create a closed-loop scenario: **to launch a real-world attack and see the corresponding alert in an enterprise-grade monitoring tool.**

This project demonstrates a full understanding of the attack lifecycle from a defensive perspective, covering everything from network design and log aggregation to threat simulation and incident analysis.

### Lab Architecture & Components

The lab operates on a private network managed by a pfSense firewall, ensuring all traffic is monitored and controlled. This creates a safe sandbox for security testing, isolated from the host network.

| Role              | Tool/OS             | Purpose                                                                 |
|:------------------|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hypervisor**    | Oracle VirtualBox   | Manages and runs all virtual machines on the host.                      |
| **Firewall/Router** | pfSense             | Segments the lab network, controls traffic, and serves as a log source. |
| **SIEM/XDR**      | Wazuh               | Ingests logs, analyzes events, and generates security alerts.           |
| **Attacker VM**   | Kali Linux          | Launches simulated attacks (e.g., port scans, vulnerability exploits).  |
| **Victim VM**     | Metasploitable2     | An intentionally vulnerable Linux server to act as the target.          |

### Key Skills Demonstrated

*   **Network Architecture & Administration:** Deployed and configured a pfSense firewall to create network segments, manage DHCP, and implement routing rules.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Installed and configured a Wazuh SIEM, deployed agents to endpoints, and successfully ingested logs from multiple sources.
*   **Log Analysis & Threat Detection:** Analyzed raw logs from network devices and endpoints within Wazuh to investigate security alerts generated by simulated attacks.
*   **Offensive Security Methodologies:** Utilized standard penetration testing tools on Kali Linux, including **Nmap** for reconnaissance and **Metasploit** for vulnerability exploitation.
*   **Virtualization & Systems Administration:** Created, configured, and managed a multi-VM environment using VirtualBox.

### Future Enhancements

This project is a living environment that I will continue to expand. My next steps include:
1.  **Upgrading the Victim Environment:** Replacing Metasploitable2 with a **Windows 10 VM** to practice detecting threats more relevant to modern corporate networks.
2.  **Adding Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS):** Integrating **Suricata** on the pfSense firewall to add signature-based threat detection at the network level.
3.  **Enhancing Log Sources:** Deploying an Apache web server to practice detecting web-based attacks like SQL injection or directory traversal.
